Lab Project 3: Graphical LCD Toy
================================

## Description
The perfect gift for the person that has everything. Just in time for the
holidays, ditch the PS5 and Xbox Series X. This little toy is all you need.
(Results may vary, childhood trauma may ensue. Side effects include boredom,
unusual aggrevation, the runs, male pattern baldness, loss to one or more
senses, and/or new confusion).


## Compile and Run
1. In the main directoy (project-3-updated-jomedinas7), type "make all" (No
quotes).

2. Enter "cd project" (No quotes) to go into the
project folder.

3. Inside the project folder, plug your MSP430 into your computer, and
type "make load" (No quotes). You should see the program begin to run.

4. To clean excess files, type "make clean" (No quotes) to remove .o
files and any other files from compilation.

## Button Functions:
On the your green board with the screen, you will see buttons S1-S4.


- Pressing **S1**: Grab your nearest platonic friend and or romantic interest
  and show them a vast(not very vast) assortment of freshly drawn hearts.

- Pressing **S2**: Grab your nearest Italian or Otaku friend and ask them what
  song is playing when you press this button. (Hint: it's on the screen.)

- Pressing **S3**: Pause that nonsense, you probably don't want to hear that
  forever. (Unless you have some sort of mental disorder.) Either way, too
  much exposure is bound to drive anyone mad.

- Pressing **S4**: Kiss your friendly toy "Goodbye". You'll hear a sound that to
  let you know that your playtime is over, along with a message. In this state, no more buttons will
  work and you'll have to restart your toy to get playing again. We don't make
  the rules (except we do).
